# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on migrating the admin content management system and purchase flow to use proper server-side APIs instead of direct client-side Firestore operations. The goal is to improve security, maintainability, and follow best practices by centralizing data operations through controlled API endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the content management page to use secure server APIs, so that content operations are properly controlled and validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the content management page THEN the system SHALL fetch content through server API endpoints
2. WHEN an admin creates or updates content THEN the system SHALL use POST/PUT API calls instead of direct Firestore operations
3. WHEN content operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback
4. WHEN unauthorized users attempt content operations THEN the system SHALL reject requests with proper authentication checks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user purchasing a subscription, I want the checkout process to use dynamic server-generated sessions, so that payment processing is secure and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates checkout THEN the system SHALL create a Stripe checkout session via server API
2. WHEN checkout parameters change THEN the system SHALL dynamically generate new sessions with current pricing
3. WHEN checkout fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN checkout succeeds THEN the system SHALL properly redirect to success page with session validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want client-side Firestore operations removed from content services, so that data access is properly secured and centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the content service is used THEN it SHALL only interact with server APIs, not direct Firestore
2. WHEN content is requested THEN the system SHALL route through authenticated API endpoints
3. WHEN content operations are performed THEN they SHALL be validated and processed server-side
4. WHEN the system starts THEN there SHALL be no direct Firestore imports in client-side content services

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want admin layout role checking verified, so that only authorized users can access admin functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses admin routes THEN the system SHALL verify admin role permissions
2. WHEN unauthorized users attempt admin access THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate error pages
3. WHEN admin sessions expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
4. WHEN role verification fails THEN the system SHALL log security events appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive system review to ensure full integration, so that all components work together seamlessly after the API migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all admin functionality SHALL work without client-side Firestore calls
2. WHEN users interact with the system THEN there SHALL be no broken API integrations or missing endpoints
3. WHEN the system is tested THEN all authentication and authorization flows SHALL function correctly
4. WHEN the review is complete THEN documentation SHALL reflect the new API-based architecture
