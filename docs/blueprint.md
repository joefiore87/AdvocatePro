- The primary font will be 'PT Sans', chosen for its excellent readability and a modern, warm aesthetic that feels both professional and approachable.
- A consistent set of simple, flat icons will provide clear visual cues for functions like profile management, letter generation, and help.
- UI interactions will be enhanced with subtle animations on form inputs and state changes to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.
