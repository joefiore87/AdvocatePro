# API Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration from client-side Firestore operations to server-side API endpoints. The migration improves security, maintainability, and follows best practices by centralizing data operations through controlled API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Services

- Created server-side content service (`src/lib/server/content-service.ts`)
- Created server-side roles service (`src/lib/server/roles-service.ts`)
- Created server-side subscription service (`src/lib/server/subscription-service.ts`)

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Content Management

- Created `/api/admin/content/raw` endpoint for raw content structure
- Created `/api/admin/content/category/[categoryId]` endpoint for specific categories
- Created `/api/admin/content/[categoryId]/[itemId]` endpoint for updating content items
- Created `/api/content` endpoint for public content

#### Authentication & Authorization

- Created `/api/auth/get-role` endpoint for getting user roles
- Created `/api/auth/set-role` endpoint for setting user roles
- Created `/api/auth/initialize-admin` endpoint for initializing admin users
- Created `/api/auth/verify-admin` endpoint for verifying admin status

#### Subscription Management

- Created `/api/subscription/check-access` endpoint for checking user access
- Created `/api/subscription/get` endpoint for getting subscription details

#### Stripe Integration

- Updated webhook handler to use server-side subscription service
- Created `/api/stripe/verify-session` endpoint for verifying checkout sessions

### 3. Client-Side Services

- Updated client-side content service to use API calls
- Updated client-side roles service to use API calls
- Updated client-side subscription service to use API calls
- Removed all direct Firestore imports from client-side code

### 4. Components

- Updated admin content page to use API calls
- Updated purchase page to use dynamic checkout API
- Updated subscription status component to use API calls
- Added error boundaries and loading skeletons

### 5. Security Enhancements

- Added server-side role verification for admin routes
- Added logging for admin access attempts
- Added rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Added proper error handling for API responses

## Benefits

### Security

- Client-side code no longer has direct database access
- All data operations go through authenticated API endpoints
- Server-side validation of all operations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Maintainability

- Clear separation of client and server code
- Centralized data access logic
- Consistent error handling
- Improved testability

### User Experience

- Better loading states
- More informative error messages
- Graceful error recovery
- Consistent UI behavior

## Future Improvements

- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Add more comprehensive logging
- Add more detailed analytics
- Implement more granular permissions
